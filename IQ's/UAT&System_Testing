			Q:: What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?

				System Testing: 
					System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes 
					testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. 
					In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.

				UAT: 
					User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through 
					a series of specific tests which determines whether the product 
					will meet the needs of its users.
